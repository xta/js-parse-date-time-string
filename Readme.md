# JS Parse Date Time String

[This is a simple page that parses your ISO 8601 date time strings (or other date time strings) and displays them as human readable in UTC & local date time](https://xta.github.io/js-parse-date-time-string/). All validation and debugging is done locally (on your browser client).
